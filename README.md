This is a test to recreate and potentially replace the pre-exisiting website for my partners business. 


To Do's:
1. At present the About and Store links simply go to the existing websites pages. The About page 
is an easy fix however the store page is a larger undertaking. I currently have an inventory system 
in the works utilizing python that I would love to see connected to a working store page on this site.
2. On the exisitng site is a lovely preview of the businesses instagram page, I would like to have this
included as well.
3. A short commercial video highlighting the process of making the product as well as some content
dedicated to getting to know the personal touch behind it.
